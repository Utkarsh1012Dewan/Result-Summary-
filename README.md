![Design preview for the Results summary component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this results summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

As I learn more about HTML and CSS I'll keep on making changes to make the design cleaner and more understandable than before
